StringLabs is not merely a group of validators; we see ourselves as approachable mentors. Located in the beautiful settings of Indonesia, weâ€™re eager to show you our operational methods, introduce you to our talented team, and share our history of excellence in the blockchain industry. Our main goal is to provide you with the crucial tools and expertise needed for seamless node management.

Although we are fairly new to this field, we bring over 1 years of experience. We are dedicated to establishing trust and ensuring consistent performance. Our top priority is maintaining uptime, which we achieve through the use of dedicated servers around the globe, backed by various 24/7 monitoring systems and secure remote signing solutions. As we validate on many networks, our primary focus remains on providing reliable service.

We set ourselves apart by offering public infrastructure, including public node endpoints and managing IBC relays across various blockchains, all while emphasizing responsible governance and active participation in the community. Our commitment to the projects we validate extends to creating detailed documentation and offering services to other validators, as well as bolstering infrastructure security through both manual oversight and automated processes
